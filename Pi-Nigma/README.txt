This is a project I started working on, where I am trying to encrypt messages using the encryption methods of the Engima machine used in WWII. This program will be run on a raspberry pi 3 and and thus the name Pi-Nigma.

Main things I want to learn from this
-Modularization of code
-Abstract classes and Interfaces
-Managing space complexity
-Electrical circuitry
-Basic GUI in Java
